When we read clean code we wont be surprised at all --- we wont notice any profound or anything 

Beautiful code makes the language was made for the code. 

Ratio of time spending on reading vs writing 10:1 --- so, we want the reading of code to be easy which essentially makes us easy to write. --- Make it easy to read.

The code has to kept well overtime. We need to look at our code all the time so it wont rot. -- Continous improvement is an intrinsic part of professionalism 

Prequel and Priciples.
-- Author talks about his previous book  - Agile software Dev - PPP 
-- The books give us thoughts , techniques and experience of other programmers and not directly make us code well.

End of lesson 1



Meaningfull names

-- Use Intention revealing names
> Everyone who reads the code should understand
> It should tell what the variable does.
> Easier to Understand and change code

Concept names for variables makes it well crafted name. -- More Explicit 

Avoid Disinformation: 
>ex : hp , aix , sco are names of unix platforms -- bad var names
>ex : 
 Grouping of accounts : 
    AccountList = [] XXXX
    accountGroup = [] //Correct 
>Even if its a list , using the name list wont be a good use 


> The programmer will not see ur comments and likely to take the code//var just like that. XXX Combination of lowercase and uppercase
> Need to make meaningfull distinctions 
   >number series?? noise words ??? XXXX



>>Using Pronounceable names : 



 public static void copyChars(char a1[], char a2[]) {
    for (int i = 0; i < a1.length; i++) {
      a2[i] = a1[i]; 
    }
  }

>> Need to use more pronounceable names while creating one.
>> Source and Destination must be more specific while naming and using same a1,a2,a3....wont be good use of creating new variable names.
