Continuation of the Clean Code book :: Today goal 41-50

Author talks about parameters in functions..

>The fewer arguments a function takes, the clearer the code becomes.
>Side effects, output arguments, flag arguments, error codes, and large functions all destroy clarity

>Robert mentions the line 'Output arguments are harder to understand than input arguments' and he says this 
because programmers usually tend to depend on output from return values.

>Bad code example :: void includeSetupPageInto(StringBuffer pageText)
  >> Reason : Here, pageText is looking like a input but its modified to get the output
_____________________________________
 
>Good code example :: StringBuffer transform(StringBuffer in)
  >> Even when returning the same object , it fits the expected pattern

>> 2 common reasons for having one argument 
       --- Asking a question : 
              > boolean fileExists("MyFile");

       --- Transforming the input :
              > InputStream fileOpen("MyFile");


Criticism about flag arguments : 
  > Author says : "Flag arguments are ugly. Passing a boolean into a function is a truly terrible practice"
-- render(true)
-- render(false)
These do completely different things depending on the flag.
This violates “do one thing”

Author is telling that instead of using one function and using flags we can use a alternative approach such
as using two functions like this :: 
     > renderForSuite()
     > renderForSingleTest()

-Dyadic and triads functions are harder to understand (  2 & 3 arguments ) 
-We need to use Verb+Keyword naming rather than dummy namings for functions 
-A function should do what it promises and nothing more 
-Functions should do something or answer something but not both ( combination of bad and good function in one )
-prefer exceptions than writing error codes 
-Functions = verbs ,  Classes = nouns  ( a code base should be read like story )
