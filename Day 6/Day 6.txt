A good comment helps
A bad / unnecessary comment clutters the code
Old comments become dangerous because they lie

Comments are not “good by default.” They are a necessary evil

If you feel the need to write a comment → it's usually a failure to express intent in code

The code will always be the only true source of information.
Comments become outdated, drift away, lose accuracy


Good Comments (rare)

>Legal requirements — copyrights, license notes, etc.

>Informative comments — when the code cannot say something directly.

>Intent comments — explain why something is done, not what.

>Clarification — only when dealing with confusing library calls or weird format strings.

>Warning comments — “don’t run this unless you have time to kill.”

>TODO comments — reminders for future work, not excuses for leaving bad code.



Bad Comments (most of them)

>Comments written to cover up bad code — fix the code instead.

>Redundant comments — say exactly what the code already shows.

>Misleading comments — when the code and comment disagree slightly (worst kind).

>Mandated comments — pointless required Javadocs for every variable/method.

>Journal comments — old change logs inside files (Git already does this).

>Noise comments — “default constructor,” “returns day of month,” etc.


Code should speak for itself.
Every comment should be treated with suspicion.
Write comments only when the code truly cannot express the idea.
Clean code > commented messy code.
