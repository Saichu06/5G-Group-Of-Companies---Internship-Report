Chapter 5 Formatting :: 

 >> Author explains that we need look at a cook first/someone looks at
 the code, they need to be impressed by the : 
     -> Neatness , Consistency and Attention to detail

>> Clean Formatting : Professionalism
>> Messy Formatting : Sloppy Engineering
>> People judge the quality of the project by who we wrote the code/cleanliness of it
>> Code Formatting is for communication : how well we communicate to someone who is making the 
change in code or just reading it. If we are able get the meaning of the code to their head and 
if they are impressed with the way wrote it.
>> Good Formatting does not refer to beauty but to clarity and communication 


>> A team must agree on one formatting format and using tools to format helps to maintain consistency
ex : in vs code there are many formatting tools like prettier ( which i use ) 

>> The answer to how big the file should be -- the smaller the better ( understanding wise ) 


Author explains using an example of a newspaper and how its formatted :  
 >> top -- Headline 
 >> first para -- High Level Summary
 >> middle and bottom -- More Details 

>> Using this in code ?  
  -- Top - classes , functions , big ideas 
  -- Middle - Detailed Logic 
  -- Bottom - Low level helpers 



>> Vertical Openess:: 
   -- Spacing between each lines
   -- examples explained with listing 5-1 AND 5-2  ( saw the code ) 

>> Vertical Density :: 
   -- Use dense lines when things belong tightly together 
   -- Some long comments break the conceptual unity 

>> Author also explains dependent functions must be close ( vertically ) 
>> The constant could have been buried in a lower function,
but it makes more sense at the higher level where the flow of logic is clearer
>> Some functions belong together not because one calls the other, but because they share meaning or behavior
