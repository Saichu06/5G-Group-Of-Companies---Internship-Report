New Chapter -- FUNCTIONS -- 


>> FitNesse Code which includes many loops functions and api's 
  -- > Problems with the code : 
         > Too long -- has many nested if loops 
         > Has too many logic's such as business , wikipage , String Building etc in one function
         > Poor naming clarity

>> Outcome of author's experience in writing function  - Functions should be small -- ( of the page size )
>> Author talks about his experience with Kent Beck and about their programming and his java project
>> He tells about how small his function lines were and was about 2-3 lines etc

>> If the functions are small -- more descriptive var names can be used 
>> Author differentiates about the 3 example codes which he told 
    >> Listing one does more work than the other 2 
    >> But his last listing ( 3 ) does only what is required and only does 'one job
    >> 3 things its doing --  
         1. Determining whether the page is a test page. 
         2. If so, including setups and teardowns. 
         3. Rendering the page in HTML.

>> Switch Statements : 
   - always do N things 
   - some switch statements do many things and violates open close operable things 
   - switch statements must differ in structure if we are using many of them 
   - not a Saas model ( my view ) 
   - Author's rule -- switch used once with polymorphism way of representing 

>> Representation of data must be using abstraction as the rest of the system can see it and every 
circumstance is unique.
>> Author speaks about using descriptive names is fine unless and until it explains what the code does 
and is used in small functions. 
>> Long descriptive name > small random name
>> It will clarify the design of the module 
>> Use the same phrases, nouns, and verbs in the function
names you choose for your modules. Consider, for example, the names includeSetup
AndTeardownPages, includeSetupPages, includeSuiteSetupPage, and includeSetupPage

>> Function Arguments 
  >> advised not to use more than 2 
  >> using a instance variable is better than passing arguments
